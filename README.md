## 📖 About This Repository

Welcome to my **Digital Garden**.

This repository is a long-term archive of my thinking process as a Computer Science undergraduate. It is structured exploration of **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**, **Embodied AI**, and **Cognitive Architectures**.

As technology evolves from LLMs to Agents and World Models, I document my journey in de-mystifying these concepts through **First Principles** and **Source Code**.

### 🌟 Core Philosophy
* **De-mystification**: Rejecting hype in favor of engineering reality.
* **The Trinity of AI**: Unification of **Simulation** (Body), **Generation** (Brain), and **Cognition** (Heart).
* **Agentic Future**: Unified equation of intelligence: $G_{t+1} = f(G_t, a_t, o_t)$
